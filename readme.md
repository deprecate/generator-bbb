# Backbone Boilerplate generator [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/yeoman/generator-bbb.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/yeoman/generator-bbb)

> This boilerplate is the product of much research and frustration. Existing
boilerplates freely modify Backbone core, lack a build process, and are very
prescriptive; Backbone Boilerplate changes that.

> Organize your application in a logical filesystem, develop your
Models/Collections/Views/Routers inside modules, and build knowing you have
efficient code that will not bottleneck your users.


## Usage

First make a new directory, and `cd` into it:
```
mkdir my-new-project && cd $_
```

Then install `generator-bbb`:
```
npm install -g generator-bbb
```

Run `yo bbb`
