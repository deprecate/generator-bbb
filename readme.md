# Backbone Boilerplate generator [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/yeoman/generator-bbb.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/yeoman/generator-bbb)

## Note: This generator has been deprecated

The Backbone Boilerplate project now has an [officially maintained](https://github.com/backbone-boilerplate/generator-bbb/) Yeoman generator which we recommend
you use instead. Please uninstall your old version of this project and use the other one for maximum happiness.

## Usage

- Install it (only once): `npm install -g generator-bbb`

- Create a new folder and cd into it: `mkdir my-new-project && cd $_`

- Run `yo bbb` to scaffold out a BBB skeleton app

- Run `grunt` to build and `grunt server` to preview


## Options

* `--skip-install`

  Skips the automatic execution of `bower` and `npm` after
  scaffolding has finished.

* `--test-framework=[framework]`

  Defaults to `mocha`. Can be switched for
  another supported testing framework like `jasmine`.
